# Welcome to the HFCollab wiki!

## Overview
This wiki is to show everyone what we can do, and to make some shit that we'll actually use. If you want access please request access VIA GitHub or PM me on HF.

## Rules
* This will be hosted on a GitRep publicly under The Unlicense.
* I will control who has the rights to make commits, PM me for access.
* Everything will be a sub-package of net.hackforums.*, you may add whatever you like, as long as I approve it. You should have your own subpackage for ALL projects. No committing to the default package, I don't care who you are. Even me.
* As soon as a topic gets 5+ stars, I will automatically make a package for it in the repository. If you have an interest in the topic, feel free to commit.
* I will be looking forward to aiding members in their effort to code ANYTHING this is gonna be seriously fun.
* This is going to strive to show off our ability to code/learn so we should absolutely be documenting what we do using conventions and JavaDocs.
* If you feel like you aren't good enough to join up, don't feel that way. If I notice you're posting shit code. I will go through and comment everything you code, helping you improve yourself and our group as a unit.
* Knowing basic Git etiquette is required, please read this before asking to join: http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide
* Knowing maven is not required, but it will impress me if you take the time to learn it.
