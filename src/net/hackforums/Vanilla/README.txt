That's where my current projects belongs. Feel free to help!

Project "Chrome Stealer":
Status: Finished
Purpose: It's a essential part of my future Java worm

Project "Zombie AI":
Status: UnFinished
Purpose: Fun

For those who are interested, this is how I plan to do the Java Worm thing:

When it's ran, it downloads all the necessary files, then
Multiple browser/IM stealers -> look for social engine login -> login to the social engine using http POST -> send message to all friends

I'll add other spreading methods if I find something interesting.
